We are writing a command line tool that acts like a chat and uses commands passed by a user to navigate through the web site. First question of a chat is the website URL. After this prompt application openes chrome web browser using selenium and chromedirver and navigates to the given URL. Next page content is scrapped together with the metadata like buttons, inputs, interaction elements, etc. In the chat window user writes commands like "Login with this credentials: username: sk, password: ala. Chatbot analisys the page content creates proper code to execute this action in the browser and ask to execute it. Please use OpenAI gpt-4 API.
